## About

A Pinning Service is a service that accepts [CIDs](https://github.com/ipld/cid/) from a user and will host the data associated with them.

The rationale behind defining a generic pinning service API is to have a baseline functionality and interface that can be provided by these services so that tools can be built on top of a common base of functionality.


## Specification 

API is defined as OpenAPI spec in YAML format:

* **[ipfs-pinning-service.yaml](./ipfs-pinning-service.yaml)**


### Documentation

API documentation generated from the YAML file can be found at:

- **[https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec](https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec/)**

### Spec lifecycle

We use the following label system to identify the state of this spec:

- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-orange.svg?style=flat-square) - A work-in-progress, possibly to describe an idea before actually committing to a full draft of the spec.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft-yellow.svg?style=flat-square) - A draft that is ready to review. It should be implementable.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-reliable-green.svg?style=flat-square) - A spec that has been adopted (implemented) and can be used as a reference point to learn how the system works.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square) - We consider this spec to close to final, it might be improved but the system it specifies should not change fundamentally.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-permanent-blue.svg?style=flat-square) - This spec will not change.
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-deprecated-red.svg?style=flat-square) - This spec is no longer in use.
