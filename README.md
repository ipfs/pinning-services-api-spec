## About

A **pinning service** is a service that accepts [CIDs](https://github.com/ipld/cid/) from a user in order to host the data associated with them.

The rationale behind defining a generic pinning service API is to have a baseline functionality and interface that can be provided by pinning services, so that tools can be built on top of a common base of functionality. 

In [this presentation](https://youtu.be/Pcv8Bt4HMVU), IPFS creator Juan Benet discusses current and potential pinning use cases, and how a standardized IPFS pinning API can meet these envisioned needs. 

The API spec in this repo is the first step towards that future.

## Specification 

This API is defined as an OpenAPI spec in YAML format:

* **[ipfs-pinning-service.yaml](./ipfs-pinning-service.yaml)**


### Documentation

You can find human-readable API documentation generated from the YAML file here:

- **[https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec](https://ipfs.github.io/pinning-services-api-spec/)**

### Code generation

https://openapi-generator.tech allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically, given the OpenAPI spec at [ipfs-pinning-service.yaml](./ipfs-pinning-service.yaml).

Give it a try before you resort to implementing things from scratch.

## Adoption

Built-in support for pinning services exposing this API is coming to IPFS tooling in Q3: 
  - [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) / [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) (CLI/HTTP API)  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-orange.svg?style=flat-square)
  - [ipfs-desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop) / [ipfs-webui](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui) (GUIs) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-orange.svg?style=flat-square)

### Client libraries
- [go-pinning-service-http-client](https://github.com/ipfs/go-pinning-service-http-client)  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-orange.svg?style=flat-square)  
  An IPFS Pinning Service HTTP Client library for Go

### Server implementations

  A Rails app that implements the IPFS Pinning Service API

### Online services
- `{your project could go here}`  
  We are currently working with pinning services to expose this API — so stay tuned!  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-orange.svg?style=flat-square)

### Spec lifecycle

We use the following label system to identify the state of aspects of this spec:

- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-wip-orange.svg?style=flat-square) — A work-in-progress, possibly to describe an idea before actually committing to a full draft of the spec
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft-yellow.svg?style=flat-square) — A draft that is ready to review, and should be implementable
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-reliable-green.svg?style=flat-square) — A spec that has been adopted (implemented) and can be used as a reference to learn how the system works
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square) — We consider this spec to close to final; it might be improved, but the system it specifies should not fundamentally change
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-permanent-blue.svg?style=flat-square) — This spec will not change
- ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-deprecated-red.svg?style=flat-square) — This spec is no longer in use
