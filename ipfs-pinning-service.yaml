  title: '(WIP) IPFS Pinning Service API'
  description: "
  
  
# Goal

The IPFS Pinning Service API is intended to be an implementation-agnostic API&#x3a;

- For use and implementation by pinning service providers

- For use in client mode by IPFS nodes and GUI-based applications


## This spec is a work in progress! 🏗️

**Your input and feedback are welcome and valuable as we develop this API spec.  

Please join the design discussion at [github.com/ipfs/pinning-services-api-spec](https://github.com/ipfs/pinning-services-api-spec).**


# The pin object lifecycle


## Creating a new pin object

The user creates a pin object via `POST /pins` and receives a `PinStatus` response:

- `id` in `PinStatus` is `cid-of-pin-object`, which can can be used for modifying and/or removing the pin in the future

- `status` in `PinStatus` indicates the current state of a pin


### Checking status of in-progress pinning

`status` (in `PinStatus`) may indicate a pending state. This means the data behind `Pin.cid` was not found on the pinning service and is being fetched from the IPFS network at large, which may take time.


In this case, the user can periodically check pinning progress via `GET /pins/{cid-of-pin-object}` until pinning is successful, or the user decides to remove the pending pin.


## Modifying an existing pin object

The user can modify an existing pin object via `POST /pins/{cid-of-pin-object}`. The new pin object `id` is returned in the `PinStatus` response. The old pin object is deleted automatically.



## Removing a pin object

A pin object can be removed via `DELETE /pins/{cid-of-pin-object}`.



# Provider hints

Pinning of new data can be accelerated by providing a list of known data
sources in `Pin.providers` and connecting at least one of them to pinning
service nodes at `PinStatus.providers`.


The most common scenario is a client putting own IPFS node's multiaddrs in
`Pin.providers`  and then directly connecting to every multiaddr returned by
Pinning Service in `PinStatus.providers` to initiate transfer.


This ensures data transfer starts immediately (without waiting for provider
discovery over DHT) and direct dial from a client works around peer routing
issues in restrictive network topologies such as NAT.


# Custom metadata

Pinning services are encouraged to add support for additional features by leveraging the following optional `meta` attributes. Note that it is OK to ommit or ignore `meta` attributes; doing so should not impact the basic pinning functionality.

- `PinStatus.meta[progress]`: Progress (as percent value) of an ongoing pinning operation, if possible to tell

- `PinStatus.meta[fail_reason]`: A service-specific reason why a pin operation failed (e.g. lack of funds, DAG too big, etc.)

- `Pin.meta[replication]`: This attribute could define how many copies a pinning service should keep



While these attributes can be vendor-specific, we encourage the community at large to leverage these `meta` attributes as a sandbox to come up with conventions that could become part of future revisions of this API.



# Authorization

An opaque authorization token is required to be sent with each request. There are two ways of doing so:

1. Using an HTTP header: `Authorization: Bearer <auth>`

2. Using a query parameter: `&auth=<auth>`


The `auth` token should be generated per device, and user should have ability to revoke each token separately.
